Summary
It is my opinion that life is a journey which allows one to develop a unique set of skills that can be harnessed and
transformed into one's niche. I welcome any opportunity that allows me to grow in experience and wisdom so I
would in turn be able to help others gain these experiences through various means.
~ S. McKenzie.
